# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the Factory-X Architecture Decisions project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the Factory-X ecosystem
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Providing helpful and constructive feedback on ADRs and technical discussions

### Unacceptable Behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing or attacking technical contributions based on the contributor's background
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews and ADR discussions
- Community meetings and events
- Any other forums created by the project maintainers

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Investigation of Potential Code Violations

All conflict is not bad as a healthy debate may sometimes be necessary to push us to do our best. It is, however, unacceptable to be disrespectful or offensive, or violate this Code. If you see someone engaging in objectionable behavior violating this Code, we encourage you to address the behavior directly with those involved. If for some reason, you are unable to resolve the matter or feel uncomfortable doing so, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, please report it following the procedure laid out below.

Reports should be directed to [info@factory-x.org](mailto:info@factory-x.org). It is the Conduct Committee's role to receive and address reported violations of this Code and to ensure a fair and speedy resolution.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

#### 1. Correction

**Impact:** Minor inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A private written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

#### 2. Warning

**Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact:** A serious violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
